Here, we demonstrate all the steps required to run the wn2vec pipeline on a small input dataset consisting of
100000 abstracts from pubmed. The pipeline can be run similarly with all PubMed abstracts or any other input source.

Preparing the data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The input data for this tutorial consists of a 100,000 file with 100,000 abstracts from PubMed that have been arranged in the 
following format.

TODO -- create a table with 3 lines that shows the format of the input data

To use the wn2vec pipeline, you may need to use a script to reformat your input data to have an analogous format.

TODO update the following link to have the path on GitHub
The input file `sample_100000_abstracts.tsv <../data/sample_100000_abstracts.tsv>`_.

TODO add the file to the data subdirectory
